\section{Abstract}

\emph{One sentence giving a very general introduction into the field:} \\

Lately, the assumptions of independence and utility maximization underlying many classical macroeconomic models have been severely challenged.  \\


\emph{One to two more sentences giving some more detail, comprehensible to scientists in the field.} \\
It is widely acknowledged that individuals economic decisions are only boundedly rational and social learning and opinion formation processes may play an important role. Nevertheless, reasoning in line with neoclassical economic theories is still widely used in the motivation of political decision making regarding economic matters. Therefore, we extend a neoclassical approach to entail heterogeneous agents whose behavior is  \\ 

\emph{One sentence clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study.} \\
Although an algorithmic formulation of these rules for the behavior of microscopic agents can be formulated with ease, the transition from the microscopic to a macroscopic description remains a challenge. \\

\emph{One sentence summarizing the main result (with the words ``here we show'' or their equivalent.)} \\

\emph{Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or how the main results adds to previous knowledge.} \\

\emph{One or two sentences to put the result into a more general context.} \\

\emph{Two to three sentences to provide a broader perspective and/or outlook, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.}
