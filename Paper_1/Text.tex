\emph{One to two more sentences giving some more detail, comprehensible to scientists in the field.} \\
It is widely a  \\ 

\emph{One sentence clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study.} \\
Although an algorithmic formulation of these rules for the behavior of microscopic agents can be formulated with ease, the transition from the microscopic to a macroscopic description remains a challenge. \\

\emph{One sentence summarising the main result (with the words ``here we show'' or their equivalent.)} \\

\emph{Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or how the main results adds to previous knowledge.} \\

\emph{One or two sentences to put the result into a more general context.} \\

\emph{Two to three sentences to provide a broader perspective and/or outlook, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.}
