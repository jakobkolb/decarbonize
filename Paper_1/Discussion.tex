\section{Results/Discussion}

\# TODO \JJK{Results are my task, discussion in colab with Finn}

\begin{itemize}
	\item discuss some general properties of the model,
	\item Show agreement of analytic solution with simulations depending on parameters, \\
		\JJK{I should probably describe, how simulations were done, at least in the SI, right?}
	\item Also do option A) mentioned in \ref{large_system_limit} and compare.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question: how to best compare to a representative agent approach?}
