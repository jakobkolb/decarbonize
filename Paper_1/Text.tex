\section{Abstract 1.0}

In resent years, the assumptions of independence and utility maximization underlying many classical macroeconomic models have been severely challenged.  \\
It is widely acknowledged that individuals economic decisions are only boundedly rational decision makers and that social learning and opinion formation processes may play an important role in the process. Nevertheless, reasoning in line with neoclassical economic theories is still widely used in the motivation of political decision making regarding economic matters. Therefore, we extend a neoclassical approach to include heterogeneous households whose individual behavior is grounded in imitation of successful behavior and homophily. \\
Although an algorithmic representation of rules for the behavior of microscopic agents can be formulated with ease, the transition from a microscopic to a macroscopic description remains a challenge. \\
Here we show that methods from statistical physics and adaptive network theory can be applied to derive a macroscopic approximation in therms of ordinary differential equations. \\
Previously, effects of heterogeneous agents were studied by introducing classes of agents. Here we show, that truly granular agents can be treated as well.\\
Considering higher moments of the capital distribution, this framework enables the study of income inequality in the context of a classical savings framework, providing a tool that might helpfully contribute to the ongoing inequality debate. \\

\section{Abstract 2.0}

Since Lucas' critique in the 70s, microfoundation has become the dominating paradigm in macroeconomic modeling. However, for the sake of mathematical traceability, even contemporary DSGE models commonly do this assuming representative agents or, if they model heterogeneous agents, assuming mutually independent rational decision makers. \\
Besides the critique of 

Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is a savings model actually a neoclassical approach?
	\item What is the state of the art in modeling heterogeneous agents? (is it really mostly a number of different representative agents?)
