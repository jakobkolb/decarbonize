abstract = {Our climate is changing. This is certain. Less certain, however, is the timing and magnitude of climate change, and the cost of transition to a low-carbon world. Therefore, many policies and programmes are still at a formative stage, and policy uncertainty is very high. This book identifies how climate change policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour in the power sector. For power companies, where capital stock is intensive and long-lived, those risks rank among the biggest and can create an incentive to delay investment. Our analysis results show that the risk premiums of climate change uncertainty can add 40{\%} of construction costs of the plant for power investors, and 10{\%} of price surcharges for the electricity end-users. Climate Policy Uncertainty and Investment Risk tells what can be done in policy design to reduce these costs. Incorporating the results of quantitative analysis, this publication also shows the sensitivity of different power sector investment decisions to different risks. It compares the effects of climate policy uncertainty with energy market uncertainty, showing the relative importance of these sources of risk for different technologies in different market types. Drawing on extensive consultation with power companies and financial investors, it also assesses the implications for policy makers, allowing the key messages to be transferred into policy designs. This book is a useful tool for governments to improve climate policy mechanisms and create more certainty for power investors.},

@article{Ans2013,
abstract = {‘Stranded assets’, where assets suffer from unanticipated or premature write-offs, downward revaluations or are converted to liabilities, can be caused by a range of environment-related risks. This report investigates the fossil fuel divestment campaign, an extant social phenomenon that could be one such risk. We test whether the divestment campaign could affect fossil fuel assets and if so, how, to what extent, and over which time horizons. Divestment is a socially motivated activity of private wealth owners, either individuals or groups, such as university endowments, public pension funds, or their appointed asset managers.1 Owners can decide to withhold their capital—for example, by selling stock market-listed shares, private equities or debt—firms seen to be engaged in a reprehensible activity. Tobacco, munitions, corporations in apartheid South Africa, provision of adult services, and gaming have all been subject to divestment campaigns in the 20th century. Building on recent empirical efforts, we complete two tasks in this report. First, we articulate a theoretical framework that can evaluate and predict, albeit imperfectly, the direct and indirect impacts of a divestment campaign. Second, we explore the case of the recently launched fossil fuel divestment campaign. We have documented the fossil fuel divestment movement and its evolution, and traced the direct and indirect impacts it might generate. In order to forecast the potential impact of the fossil fuel campaign, we have investigated previous divestment campaigns such as tobacco and South African apartheid.},
annote = {This paper points out some of the possible effects of divestment and makes qualitative and comparative arguments about the scale of their effects.

The effects are threefold:
1) supply and demand dynamics arising from socially responsible investors selling of their fossil fuel assets - effects thought to be small, since free assets tend to be allocated rapidely to investors that are indifferet about climate impacts. 

2) dept market dynamics arising from pressure on credit suppliers (e.g. banks) not to loan to fossil fuel companies. On less liquid markets, the retreavel of a limited number of suppliers can have a significant impact. Impacts are thought to be of medium size with bigest effects on coal companies (since dept markets for coal loans are thought to be least liquid)

3) Stigmatisation of certain firms or industries.
Impacts of Stigmatization are thought to be of comparibly the biggest impact, since they can lead to stricter legislation for stigmatized firms reducing business opportunities. Therefore even the the beginning of stigmatization can lead to insecurity about future cash flows of affected industries which might compress trading multiples and lead to higher hurdle rates and capital costs for capex projects.
The problem is, that the effects of stigmatization are very hard to quantify.},

@article{Hong2009,
abstract = {We provide evidence for the effects of social norms on markets by studying "sin" stocks-publicly traded companies involved in producing alcohol, tobacco, and gaming. We hypothesize that there is a societal norm against funding operations that promote vice and that some investors, particularly institutions subject to norms, pay a financial cost in abstaining from these stocks. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that sin stocks are less held by norm-constrained institutions such as pension plans as compared to mutual or hedge funds that are natural arbitrageurs, and they receive less coverage from analysts than do stocks of otherwise comparable characteristics. Sin stocks also have higher expected returns than otherwise comparable stocks, consistent with them being neglected by norm-constrained investors and facing greater litigation risk heightened by social norms. Evidence from corporate financing decisions and the performance of sin stocks outside the US also suggest that norms affect stock prices and returns. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
